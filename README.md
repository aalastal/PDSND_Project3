### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I employed Python to analyze data pertaining to bike share systems in three prominent cities within the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. This involved crafting code to import the data and derive insightful insights through the calculation of descriptive statistics. Additionally, I developed a script that captures user input for an interactive terminal-based encounter, allowing for the dynamic presentation of these statistics.

### Files used
The required files for running this program are: 
1. chicago.csv - Stored in the data folder, the chicago.csv file is the dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of Chicago provided by Udacity.
2. new_york_city.csv - Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of New York provided by Udacity.
3. washington.csv - Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of Washington provided by Udacity. Note: This does not include the 'Gender' or 'Birth Year' data.

### Requirements
The program was scripted using Python (version 3.10.9) and depends on the following libraries: 
1. pandas=1.5.3 
2. numpy=1.23.5
